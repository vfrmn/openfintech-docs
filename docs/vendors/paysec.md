**Description:** 
 
: [EN]  PaySec is a young and dynamic company with a team offering vast experience and proven success in the payments industry. The company was founded in 2014 and quickly established crucial relationships with hard-to-reach Asian institutions, particularly in China, Thailand and Indonesia. In order for PaySec to offer the best technology for Merchants, it incorporated a leading technology supplier and as a result now boasts software completely under its control and evolution. These developments have placed PaySec in a position to quickly build on its already considerable success in the PSP market. PaySec is led by a Western management team experienced in bridging the gap for Merchants entering into new Asian markets.
